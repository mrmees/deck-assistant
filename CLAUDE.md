# Deck Assistant - Project Memory

## Design Decisions

### Home Assistant Labels
The only use of labels in Home Assistant is to allow the user the convenience of filtering out other items during the wizard's group and entity selection steps. Labels are NOT used for any functional purpose - they are purely optional and help users who want to pre-tag entities for easier selection in future configurations.
